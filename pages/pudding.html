            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>
                <p>Cook sugar in a small, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until golden.</p>
                <p>Pour caramel into a 10-inch round baking dish, tilting to coat the bottom and sides.</p>
                <p>Set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Beat cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth.</p>
                <p>Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well incorporated.</p>
                <p>Mix in milks and vanilla until smooth.</p>
                <p>Pour into the caramel-coated baking dish.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel.</p>
                <p>Place the baking dish inside the roasting pan on the towel, then place the roasting pan on the oven rack.</p>
                <p>Fill the roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is just set, 50 to 60 minutes.</p>
                <p>Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator until completely cooled, 8 hours to overnight.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                To unmold, run a knife around the edges of the baking dish and invert onto a rimmed serving platter.
            </li>
        </ol>
