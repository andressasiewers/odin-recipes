                <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
                <li>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

                <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. 
                    Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; 
                    cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. 
                    Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. 
                    Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion.
                    Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour.
                    Drain and add to beans.</p>
                </li>

                <li> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

                <li>
                    <p>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish.
                        Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans.
                    Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper.
                    Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more.</p>
                </li>

                <li>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</li>
